      <h2>ðŸ‘¤ About the Creator</h2>
      <p>The Tredecim Calendar was imagined, built, and refined by a young creator passionate about order, logic, and elegance in systems â€” especially those that govern everyday life.</p>

      <p>This calendar wasnâ€™t made to be radical or confusing, but to fix whatâ€™s long been broken. It draws from history, language, mathematics, and practicality to create something that just makes sense.</p>

      <p>Whether youâ€™re a calendar nerd, developer, teacher, or just tired of inconsistent month lengths â€” Tredecim offers a refreshingly simple and well-structured alternative.</p>

      <p>Thank you for exploring this idea. Itâ€™s a work in progress, constantly evolving with new features, tools, and input from those who share the vision.</p>

      <p style="font-style: italic; color: #666;">â€“ Creator of Tredecim, Mostafa Ismail</p>
