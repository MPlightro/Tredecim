      <h2>❓ Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why start the year on August 1st?</h3>
        <p>It gives time to prepare and aligns the 13-month cycle cleanly with a modern adoption window, especially starting from a leap year.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Why does February have 29 days?</h3>
        <p>February is kept special, holding the 365th day in non-leap years — maintaining a sense of tradition and balance.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>How does Intermission work?</h3>
        <p>It appears every 4 years after July 28, acting as a weekday buffer before August 1. It's not part of any month but keeps weekdays aligned year to year.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Will existing holidays be supported?</h3>
        <p>Yes! The Tredecim Calendar maps major holidays to fixed or weekday-based equivalents. See the "Holidays" section for details.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>Is there a way to sync with my phone?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can subscribe to the calendar as a web-based .ics feed to view Tredecim dates in your calendar app.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="faq">
        <h3>How do I convert dates?</h3>
        <p>The converter tool lets you switch between Gregorian and Tredecim formats with weekday alignment preserved.</p>
